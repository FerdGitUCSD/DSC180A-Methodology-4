## Questions

### Question 1: What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the topic of smart contracts. Smart contracts are pieces of code that live on the blockchain. They can be written to carry out a great number of tasks from financial transactions, supply chain management, and digital asset ownership. Once deployed, they cannot be modified, and are ran using the compute power of the blockchain network hosting it. Smart contracts and how we can use them in our own project have been so fun to explore.
