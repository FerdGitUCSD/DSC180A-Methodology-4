## Questions

### Question 1: What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the topic of smart contracts. Smart contracts are pieces of code that live on the blockchain. They can be written to carry out a great number of tasks from financial transactions, supply chain management, and digital asset ownership. Once deployed, they cannot be modified, and are ran using the compute power of the blockchain network hosting it. Smart contracts and how we can use them in our own project have been so fun to explore.

### Question 2: Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
A potential investigation I would like to persue for my Quarter 2 Project is the idea of a document verification service for either the UC System or UCSD in general. It would be a portal for employers to be able to verify UC provided official credentials such as degrees or official transcripts in order to prove that they are original, came from the original source, and are undoctored. This would be done using smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain.

### Question 3: What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
One potential change I'd make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project is to maybe expand from only focusing on document credentials into other more detailed records or services.

### Question 4: What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
One technique I'd be interested in using for our project is the integration of UCSD system APIs and login features in order to make it a full-fledged portal that integrates seamlessly with the UCSD website.
